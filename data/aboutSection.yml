  ## About me

  20 years experience in building data science teams and deliver business impact using data.

  ### I translate business problems into data science language and back.

  I hold a PhD in Computation Neuroscience and specialize in optimizing business outcomes by using ML and building data science teams from scratch. 
  My resume includes notable companies such as Biocatch, Microsoft, Gong, Playtika, Vianai and Nvidia.
  
  My motto is “Data + Science = Business Value”. Quoting from my recently published article [“ML Prescriptive Canvas for Optimizing Business Outcomes”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10333):
  
  “While the lion’s share of data science projects uses a predictive approach, to drive improvements these predictions should become decisions”
