# The Joy of Data
*A Data Science Blog by Hanan Shteingart, PhD*

In this blog I would like to share some insights, tricks and methods I've encounterd throught my career as a data scientist. I might also share problems which I don't have solution to, maybe you know the answer and can write me about it.
I will use Jupyer notebooks for the actuall posts generation. Stay tuned.
